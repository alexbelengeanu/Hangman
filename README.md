# Hangman

How the game works : Every word in the list has its own index. The computer chooses a random index, and the word corresponding to the respective index will be the secret word.<br>
-The player then tries to guess the word, by guessing one letter at a time. Once he/she guesses a letter that fills in the random word, all the occurrences of that letter are revealed. There is a maximum limit of 7 wrong guesses. The game ends when the player has guesses every letter in the word or when he reaches the maximum number of wrong guesses.<br><br>
   @The main focus while implementig this game, was to manipulate strings and repetitive loops.
